			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<div id="sect1">
				<h2>When and where does the club meet?</h2>
				<h3>We're located in the Media Center after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays &nbsp;(unless otherwise specified).</h3>
				
				<h2>Do I have to study exclusively for the ACT or SAT?</h2>
				<h3>No. Our focus is on the ACT and SAT but you are welcome to come in and study for any other exam or class. We'll be happy to work with you, either way.</h3>
				
				<h2>Where can I register for the ACT and SAT?</h2>
				<h3>Scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the Useful Links section to register for either exam. Alternativly, you can click the Register Now button at the top right of the page.</h3>
				
				<h2>Where will I be taking the exams?</h2>
				<h3>After you start the registration process, it will ask you which facility you would like to take your exam.</h3>
				
				<h2>How long are the segments for each exam?</h2>
				<h3>The ACT has an English, Mathematics, Reading, Science, and optional Writing section. The SAT has a Writing and Language, Mathematics, and Reading section.</h3>
				
				<h2>What is the time limit and the amount of questions for each section on the ACT?</h2>
				<h3>English: 75 questions in 45 minutes. Math: 60 questions in 60 minutes. Reading: 40 questions in 35 minutes. Science: 40 question, in 35 minutes. Writing (optional): 1 essay in 40 minutes</h3>
				
				<h2>What is the time limit and the amount of questions for each section on the SAT?</h2>
				<h3>Writing and Language: 44 questions in 35 minutes. Math: 58 questions in 80 minutes. Reading: 52 questions in 65 minutes</h3>
				
				<h2>Can I take both the SAT and the ACT?</h2>
				<h3>Absolutely. We recommend taking both test because most of the time, students excel in one or the other. This is mostly because some students have stronger time management skills, which is helpful for the ACT, while other students prefer having more time but harder questions with the SAT.</h3>
				
				<h2>What year should I take my first exam?</h2>
				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px">You should prepare to take either the SAT or the ACT late in your sophomore year, especially if you are taking adcanced classes. This gives you the best opportunity to prepare yourself for success in later attempts of the exam. This will also give you a good feel as of what areas you are strong in and what areas you are weaker in.</h3>
